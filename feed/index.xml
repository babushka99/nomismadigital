										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money Transfer, or Remittances Business accounts for US$ 600+ Billion worth of transfers every year. Despite the COIVD19 times, eventually, long-term the value transferred every year will only increase.</p>
<p>The reason you’re on this page is because you’re looking at the ability of getting started in this business somehow and are trying to navigate the complex space. Trying to make heads and tails of this maze of complex jargon, ever-confusing regulations, licensing woes, compliance, access to banking, payment processing and in general just to understand the general nomenclature of this business.</p>
<p>You’ve ended at the right place.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we have literally published 1,000s of articles, Q&amp;As, podcasts, videos, how-to’s, etc. to help the cross-border payments community learn the intricacies and nuances of the “as-a-service” business model.</p>
<p>At present we offer help in getting setup with the money transfer business in four distinct geographies:</p>
<h2>Understanding Remittance-as-a-Service</h2>
<p><a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-remittance-business/remittance-as-a-service-raas-pricing">Remittance-as-a-Service</a> or <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-remittance-business/remittance-as-a-service-raas-pricing">RaaS</a> is a term that was coined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisalkhan99/">Faisal Khan</a> (our CEO &amp; Co-founder) in 2013. The quest was to find a legal method to be able to offer white-label remittance services to startups and incumbents alike for the US market (which is fiercely guarded, complex, and expensive to operate in).</p>
<p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-remittance-business/what-is-remittance-as-a-service-raas">What is Remittance-as-a-Service</a>? / <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-remittance-business/what-is-money-transfer-as-a-service">What is Money Transfer-as-a-Service</a></p>
<p>At the time, circa 2012, white-labeled money transfer services were literally non-existent. The ones that were available, were simply out of reach of the vast majority of startups and incumbents, even banks from emerging markets, due to the prohibitive pricing structure that was available at the time.</p>
<p>If you wanted to enter the United States market for remittance-as-a-service (or money transfer-as-a-service), the odds were stacked against you, unless of course, you had deep pockets.</p>
<p>Even if you did, those who did manage to get going, the results were short-lived. In 2013, the United States government, particularly the Department of Justice, launched something called <em>Operation Choke Point</em> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point">Wikipedia Entry</a>). This led to the start of the bank’s de-risking process, which many attribute to Barclays UK<sup>1,2</sup> that started closing down the accounts of money transfer operators (the most infamous case of that of money transfer operators sending money to Somalia).</p>
<p>Whilst Operation Choke Point officially ended in August 2017<sup></sup> (under the Trump Administration), but the damage had been done. It set a precedent that was mirrored and copied the world over and there was not was to reverse the wave.</p>
<p>This really got us thinking, surely that has to be a better way to serve the international money transfer market? All these hurdles and problems naturally created market demand. The market needed a pre-packaged solution for the entire value chain of the money transfer business.</p>
<p>We literally worked diligently for over two years refining what we eventually became to call ‘<a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-remittance-business/remittance-as-a-service-raas-pricing">remittance-as-a-service</a>‘. Many doors were shut on our faces, many emails and calls went unanswered, but we did not stray from our mission. After 127 rejections (yes, you read that right, you can watch the video story at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Sggc9HNps">Want Results? Just Don’t Give-up!</a>), we were finally able to piece together what we aiming for.</p>
<p>A packaged solution, that encompassed licensing, compliance, AML, banking, payment processing, and white-label web presence for the money transfer market.</p>
<p>No wonder the quote, “The dream is free. The hustle is sold separately.” was something we could resonate with.</p>
<h2>Getting Started?</h2>
<p>If you are getting started in the money transfer business, then the one thing we can recommend is to learn and absorb as much knowledge about the field as you can. We have invested a lot of energy and time in making a very comprehensive series of videos (the only of its kind on YouTube). Over 150+ videos explains the various facets and nuances of the cross-border money transfer business. All these videos are short (less than 10 minutes) and explain in plain English the intricacies of the remittance business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, we have been advocates of sharing information and educating everyone for the greater benefit and good of society. This includes individuals, startups, would-be-entrepreneurs, incumbents, colleagues, professionals in the field, etc.</p>
<p>However, this open-door policy has started to take its toll on our resources &ndash; specifically human resources &ndash; and the available time we have.</p>
<p>It is with regret that we now inform our patrons, that we will not be onboarding any new pre-revenue clients (or startups that are pre-revenue).</p>
<p>Allow us to explain our reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single day, we get between 5 -10 relevant leads &ndash; on many days, the numbers are much higher. A vast majority of them start with &ldquo;I would like to start a X-Business&rdquo; where x=money transfer, neo bank, cross border payments, crypto, blockchain, bitcoin trading, e-wallet, EMI, PSP, merchant processor, etc.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that most of these inquiries will never become functioning businesses mostly due to financing (or the lack thereof).</p>
<p>Most of these inquiries involve asking a myriad of questions, trying to get educated, and validating their various business ideas for free. While we have always welcomed enthusiastic new entrants to come and &ldquo;pick my brain&rdquo;, it is becoming increasingly difficult to entertain them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having done over 7,500+ calls, we&rsquo;ve noticed the following patterns (not all may be applicable to you).</p>
<ul>
<li>Unwillingness to spend 50, 100, 200 or so hours in learning about their business vertical even though they have never done the business before</li>
<li>Almost everyone seems to have &ldquo;a big idea&rdquo; for becoming the next neo-bank, the next large money transfer company, the next big bitcoin exchange, yet, they struggle to even read 5 pages of condensed material</li>
<li>Their &ldquo;business&rdquo; is still in the brainstorming/ideas stage and they have no idea how to proceed with any of the pre-requisites but are still unwilling to read or learn about it</li>
<li>Basic company formation is not even started and licenses are yet to be applied for</li>
<li>Most of these entrepreneurs/startups, don&rsquo;t read the resources we have provided or watch the instructional videos, even when prompted to do so</li>
<li>Their collective research on the subject/industry is very limited</li>
<li>Spending time in reading and understanding written material is frowned upon</li>
<li>Most will argue and try to bend official rules (because they have a limited understanding of the laws and regulations)</li>
<li>Far too many people fudge the information on their application forms</li>
<li>Very, very few people can actually make a financial model for their proposed big idea</li>
<li>Even fewer people can make a legally compliant flow of funds</li>
<li>Almost no one has undertaken even the very basic anti-money laundering training &ndash; we have been in countless completely fruitless conversations trying to explain what needs to be done, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the most important three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a thankless job</li>
<li>No appreciation for our time</li>
<li>Not having the courtesy to reply back to emails, once information was gained from us</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in view, we have decided not to offer our services or schedule calls with pre-revenue entrepreneurs/startups.</p>
<p>We are sure many of you would find this distasteful, but we would urge you to understand that we are taking this step after a lot of deliberation and hard discussions. It feels unfair to our paying clients if we continue to waste time with non-serious leads who have no intention of moving forward with us. We believe it makes more sense &ndash; for our business and our mental health &ndash;&nbsp; to prioritize those who appreciate the assistance we provide and who have a strong probability of becoming a paying client.</p>
<p>However, we are not shutting the door on you. If you believe you are a startup, even pre-revenue, but can demonstrate your understanding of the business and proof of funds, please <a href='https://faisalkhan.com/contact'>contact us</a> so that we may discuss further.</p>
